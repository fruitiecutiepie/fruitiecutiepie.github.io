# personal-website

This project was made for a university assignment, which requirements are listed below:

## Scenario

Create your personal web site that includes at least the following three pages:

*	A home page (Providing general information about yourself)
*	A web page that briefly introduces one of your favourite places/cities/areas. This could be a place where you have been or you have dreamed to go.
*	A web page about one of your favourite things that you would like others to appreciate it as you do.

## Detailed Requirements

1.	The Home page focuses on yourself and as such must contain:

	  *	Your photo, name and student ID
	  *	Some information about yourself as what you want others to know about you. This information may be presented by texts, images and video clips.
	  *	Hyperlinks to other two pages and your UTS email address.

	  You must include sections of text and images/animations that are formatted using Cascading Style Sheets.  The contents could describe your education/employment background, your life, hobbies, sporting activities, or any other topic you like to tell others about you. The contents can be factual or fabrication. The aim of this section is for you to demonstrate your skills of presenting/organising contents and CSS competence. Therefore you must include the following CSS as a minimum:

	  1. An external CSS file that contains at least
	  
			*	A style that formats all paragraph tags
			*	A generic class definition that is used somewhere on the web page
			*	A class that is specific to a particular tag
			*	A style that formats a text heading
			
			This CSS file must be inked to the home page.
	   
	  2. Embedded style that defines the following
	  
			*	An id selector that applies to an H1 tag
			*	A contextual style 
			*	A class to format anchor tag hyperlinks (hover event)
			
	  3. Multiple In-line styles
  
2.	The Favourite Place page must include sections of texts describing the place, such as people, scenery, culture, food, etc. and the reasons why you like it, with some pictures showing the beauty of the place. It must have links to Internet web sites where further information about the place can be obtained. Some of such links should be reached by clicking on some pictures. It should be specific to the place, such as a city, town, village or an area, but not about a country in general. 

  	It must have the links to other two pages. The external CSS file used in the home page should be applied to this page as well. Some inline CSS are also required in this page.

3.	The Favourite Thing page contains the description of the thing, and the reasons why you like it. The examples of the thing could be a mobile phone, an iPad, a game, a book, a music instrument, a bicycle, a car, a camera, a toy, a tool, etc. You must present a thing, not an activity. Images and/or animations should be used to make the webpage more attractive and interesting. Reference links to Internet websites for further information are required. It must have the links to other two pages. Define your own embedded CSS styles to decorate this page. The minimum requirements for CSS styles are:

	  *	At least one group style for two or more tags
	  *	At least one CSS class
	  *	At least one contextual style (CSS style applied to a tag within another tag)
	  *	An hover style applied to <a> tag.

	And multiple in-line CSS styles.
